# RipForge - Claude Instructions

## Server Rules (MANDATORY)

**Read `servers.md` before ANY server operation.**

### Golden Rules

1. **NEVER run commands on any server** unless the user explicitly asks
2. **NEVER deploy, pull, or restart** without explicit permission
3. **"Push it", "deploy", "tag and build"** = git commit/tag/push/release ONLY. NOT server commands.
4. You may SSH to check status/logs if asked, but **do NOT make changes**

### Rip-Specific Rule

**NEVER restart the service while a rip is in progress.** Restarting kills the rip.
If unsure, ask: "Ready to restart the service?"

### If You Violate These Rules

Say: "Supreme master, I apologize for disappointing you yet again."
